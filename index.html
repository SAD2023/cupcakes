                    <p>These brown sugar cupcakes were my newest adventures and I
                        canâ€™t <br> wait for you to try them. They are so simple, flavorful
                        and <br> comforting (can a cupcake  be comforting? of course!).
                        Perfect <br> for any crisp day of the season and as we get into the
                        holiday <br> season they will surely please a crowd.</p>

                <p class="about">In 2003, Tiffini had an idea of creating a cupcake only bakery!
                    Then there was no such thing as a cupcake only bakery and the
                    idea sounded very wild and crazy. But why was it common to find a
                    bakery full of cakes in many flavors but only a few with cupcakes
                    in many flavors. Why not give people cupcakes, in lots of delicious
                    flavors to choose from, every day.

                    In March 2004, Yummy Cupcakes went into the cupcake business and has
                    grown now to over 400 cupcake flavors with selections in vegan, gluten-less
                    and sugar-free plus an exciting selection of specialty Cupcake treats!</p>
